# Predicting Employee Turnover of a Business
This is a Project from the Data Scientist Formation Degree by Data Science Academy Brazil. The idea is to build a classification model to predict if an employee will or not leave the company based on the variables satisfaction level, number of projects one is working, number of hours worked in a month and the years this person is in that company.
Activities performed:
* Data Exploration and Analysis
* Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Barplots)
* Correlation check
* Feature Engineering with Random Forest to select the best attributes for the model
* Classification: Training and Prediction with Random Forest **(99% accurate)** and XGBoost **(97% accurate)**
* (Creation of Random Forest and XGBoost with tidymodels)
* Creation of a Shiny App for user interaction and make predictions.
