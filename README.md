# Predicting Employee Turnover of a Business
This is a Project from the Data Scientist Degree by Data Science Academy Brazil. The idea is to predict if an employee will or not leave the company based on satisfaction level, number of projects one is working, number of hours worked in a month and the years this person is in that company.
It was performed:
* Data Exploration and Analysis
* Data Visualization (Histograms, Boxplots, Barplots)
* Correlation check
* Feature Engineering with Random Forest to select the best attributes for the model
* Training and Prediction with Random Forest **(99% accurate)** and XGBoost **(97% accurate)**
* (Creation of Random Forest and XGBoost with tidymodels)
* Creation of a Shiny App for user interaction and make predictions.
